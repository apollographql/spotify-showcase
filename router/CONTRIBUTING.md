We want this template to be useful to as many members of the community as possible, so please contribute any ideas you have! You should start by [searching for an existing discussion](https://github.com/apollographql/router-template/discussions?discussions_q=) and adding your thoughts to it. If we've agreed on a strategy for solving a problem, but we haven't implemented it yet, feel free to create a pull request!

We will be prioritizing new features based on how many people have "voted" for an idea using the little up-arrow button, so if you'd like to see certain improvements prioritized, please click that button!

You can also hop into our Discord server to discuss all things GraphQL and Apollo:
