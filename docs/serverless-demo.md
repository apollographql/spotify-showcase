# Welcome to the Apollo Showcase Demo

Welcome to the **{{ graph.name }}** API! 🎉 You can follow along in this README to walk through a guided demo or just explore yourself.

> If you're new to Apollo, learn more about GraphOS in [our docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/).

# So what did clicking that button do to get me here?

In creating this demo, we've set up GraphOS to work with two GraphQL APIs we have hosted for you:

- _spotify_: Exposes the Spotify REST API
- _playback_: Exposes subscriptions for playback functionality coming from the Spotify REST API including the associated `mutation` operations

This includes provisioning a serverless instance of the [Apollo Router](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/routing/cloud) that can route traffic between our two GraphQL APIs 🚀

# Demo Guide: Where should I start?

> There are links in this demo that might navigate you around, it might be helpful to open two windows to keep this README up on one side of the screen (or right-click->Open in a new window)\_

## Running operations

You need a way to query your graph and [GraphOS Explorer](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/explorer) is built to make this easy. You can try querying this graph using [Explorer]({{ graph.url.explorer }}). Try running your first operation:

```gql
query RootWebsiteQuery($offset: Int, $limit: Int) {
  me {
    playlists(offset: $offset, limit: $limit) {
      pageInfo {
        offset
        limit
        hasNextPage
      }
      edges {
        node {
          id
          name
          uri
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The [Apollo Router also supports GraphQL subscriptions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/operations/subscriptions/)!

```gql
subscription PlaybackStateSubscriberSubscription {
  playbackStateChanged {
    isPlaying
    progressMs
  }
}
```

GraphOS Explorer also supports tabs. Open a new tab and try pausing the running subscription:

```gql
mutation PausePlaybackMutation {
  pausePlayback {
    playbackState {
      isPlaying
    }
  }
}
```

## Identifying client operations

You can begin [identifying your client traffic](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/metrics/client-awareness) by ensuring the proper headers are sent. GraphOS will automatically associate the graph usage with the identified client information:

| Header name                    | Header value                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apollographql-client-name`    | The name of your integration.                                                            |
| `apollographql-client-version` | Increment this value with version numbers for your integration as its API usage changes. |

> If you test out API operations in the [Explorer]({{ graph.url.explorer }}), add the `apollographql-client-name` and `apollographql-client-version` headers with `Apollo Explorer` and `main` (or whatever values you like).

If you have a client project, simply setting the `name` and `version` properties in the `ApolloClient` constructor will automatically add these header values to your requests for you. You can see how we set that in the Spotify Showcase Website [here](https://github.com/apollographql/spotify-showcase/blob/main/client/src/apollo.ts#L76):

```graphql
const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: new HttpLink({
    uri: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql'
  }),
  name: 'Spotify Showcase Website',
  version: '1.0'
});
```

Once you've sent some traffic, head over to the [Clients tab]({{ graph.url.clients }}) and you should see the traffic being identified now 🎉

## Adding a new GraphQL API to GraphOS

You can view all of the GraphQL APIs in the [subgraphs tab]({{  graph.url.subgraphs }}). Try adding SpaceX to the demo by using the "Add a subgraph" button. You'll use https://spacex-production.up.railway.app/ for the routing URL and it should be able to fetch the subgraph schema/

> If you try adding a subgraph that doesn't support introspection or Apollo Federation, you will have to paste your schema into the UI using the "Advanced options" drop down.

Since we added a new subgraph into our demo, we'll have a launch with these updates for our Apollo Router. Head over to the [Launches tab]({{ graph.url.launches }}) to see the update run through the appropriate checks and be deployed. Once it has deployed, head over to [Explorer]({{ graph.url.explorer }}) and you should be able to add some of the SpaceX operations to your graph:

```gql
query RoolWebsiteQuery($offset: Int, $limit: Int) {
  company {
    name
  }
  me {
    playlists(offset: $offset, limit: $limit) {
      pageInfo {
        offset
        limit
        hasNextPage
      }
      edges {
        node {
          id
          name
          uri
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Viewing your graphs changelog

Every update that is successfully made to your graph will appear as a changelog entry. Since we just added the SpaceX API, we can head over to the [Changelog]({{ graph.url.changelog }}) tab and wee a list of everything we added.

You can also see a more detailed breakdown of the schema with the ability to search to find whatever you need. You can filter by multiple criteria, like specific subgraphs or even Entities you have defined.

> If you don't know what an Entity is in [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation), head over to our [docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/entities) to learn more.

## Understanding the usage of your graph

The Apollo Router automatically collects usage information on your graph based on what fields are being requested from client applications. You can start diving into specific fields and their usage in the graph by heading to the [Fields tab]({{ graph.url.fields }}).

In the top search bad of the Fields tab, try searching for `CurrentUser` to find the `me` field we queries. You can also click the flied insights button to the right to view a more detailed breakdown of the usage in this specific field.

## Knowing when to start pruning your graph

Since GraphOS has the usage information of our graph, it can also identify fields marked with the `@deprecated` directive and tell us if they are still being useed or not. In the same [Fields tab]({{ graph.url.fields }}), select the "Deprecations" at the top and you should see some deprecated fields that were added from the SpaceX API.

## Looking at individual operations

In addition to the aggregate usage information we saw in the Fields tab, GraphOS also enables you to view sample individual traces that includes resolver level traces 🙌. Head over to the [Operations]({{ graph.url.operations }}) tab and you can explore the traces generated from the operations we ran in previous steps.

## Testing out making a change to your subgraphs locally

Every change to a subgraph should be validated using [Schema Checks](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/delivery/schema-checks). We'll need to [install Rover](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/getting-started), the GraphOS CLI interface, to run schema checks in this demo. Once you have Rover installed, we'll need to configure the authentication of Rover with your graph.

Open your graph's Settings page and select the API Keys tab. Click Create New Key and give it a name. Then in a terminal window, run the rover config command:

```shell
rover config auth --profile=demo
```

> We're adding the authorization under a 'demo' profile since we're configuring a graph API key. You can learn more about the configuration profiles for rover's auth [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/commands/config)

The terminal should prompt you to past in your API key. Once you've pasted in your API key, we're all setup to run checks against our graph. Now we need to get an example schema. Download [this schema](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/michael-watson/197152123c125fc6653b3bdb84265946/raw/bc5044d2dabd0aca18d022865538085efa90ad16/gistfile1.txt) file locally; you can open the link and save through the browser as `schema.graphql`.

Now let's switch back to the terminal window and run that command:

```shell
rover subgraph check {{ graph.ref }} --profile=demo --name=spotify --schema={PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_SCHEMA}
```

You should see a failed output with a url. Go ahead and click that URL to see why the check failed. Shema Checks use our graphs usage information to validate whether a change is safe to make or not 🚀

## Seeing shcema checks in a PR

You can also see schema checks in a PR, but you'll have to [fork the demo repo](https://github.com/apollographql/spotify-showcase/fork). Once you've forked the repo, you'll need to do some minimumm configuration:

1. [Ensure the Apollo app is installed in the repo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/ci-cd/#displaying-schema-check-results-on-github-pull-requests)
2. Add these secrets to your GitHub Actions secrets:

- **APOLLO_KEY**: You can use the key we used to configure rover in this example or feel free to create a new key.
- **APOLLO_GRAPH_REF**: You'll want to set this to {{ graph.ref }}

Now that the new repo is configured, navigate to the `subgraphs/spotify/schema.graphql` file. Find the `type Query` and delete the `me` field from the schema (make sure you also delete the comment above it supprounded by three quotes """). Commit that change to a new branch and you'll see the schema checks pop up in the PR with the apollo app providing a link to [Apollo Studio checks page]({{ graph.url.checks }}).

> If you don't see the Apollo App in your checks, you probably don't have the [Apollo App installed](<(https://www.apollographql.com/docs/rover/ci-cd/#displaying-schema-check-results-on-github-pull-requests)>). You can also click into the individual actions and see the url printed out in the console window

## Configuring your schema checks

We got to see a breaking change above, but there are a lot of things that [Schema Checks](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/delivery/schema-checks) covers:

- [Composition checks](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/delivery/schema-checks#composition-checks). For supergraphs, verify whether your proposed changes to a subgraph schema will successfully compose with your other subgraph schemas.
- [Operation checks](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/delivery/schema-checks#operation-checks). Compare your proposed schema changes against historical operations to verify whether the changes will break any of your graph's active clients.
- [Linter checks](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/delivery/schema-linter). Analyze your proposed schema changes for violations of formatting rules and other GraphQL best practices.

You can also [configure all of these checks](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphos/delivery/check-configurations) to fit the needs of your project. Maybe you need to ensure checks run against multiple environments of your graph (i.e. `pre-prod` and `prod`) or exclude past operations from an old client now that usage is low.

## Wrap up

We've covered some of the basics of GraphOS in this demo, but we can't cover everything.
